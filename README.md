## 🧠 Overview

**Thato Maelane NFT Access Pass** is a **front-end-only demo project** designed to replicate a real NFT verification system. By simulating wallet-based access control, users can explore how NFTs might be used to restrict or allow access to gated digital content.

This is a beginner-friendly, client-side project that introduces the concept of token-gated access — a fast-growing use case in the world of Web3.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user types their Ethereum wallet address.
2. If it **matches Thato Maelane's NFT holder address**:
→ access is granted.
3. Otherwise, access is denied with a call to action to "Buy Thato Maelane’s NFT on OpenSea."
